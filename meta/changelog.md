# 1.2.0 Editing Boards, Sharing With Others

* It's now possible to successfully share Idea Otter grains with other users who will be able to edit and contribute to them. In the future, control of these grains will be much more fine-tuned.
* Board colors and names can be edited.
* Added autopublish and insecure back into the app because it's not really necessary with Sandstorm.
