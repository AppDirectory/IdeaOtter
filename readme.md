# Idea Otter

> A place for gathering ideas.

IdeaOtter is a Sandstorm app, you can install the most recent version from [their app store](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/du1nkmp0edheyjq07rm8s1tzr4qs4ut7k24vc2ps0vzm30zp77y0). If you want instructions on how to get your own Sandstorm instance up, [check their documentation](https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/administering/).

# Dev

IdeaOtter uses [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) as a framework. If you [set up Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/quickstart), you can just run `meteor` in your terminal to get your own local version.

Note, if you're looking to run this on a server - IdeaOtter offloads all authority and such to Sandstorm, meaning that what ever you add will be freely accessible by whomever has access to your server.
